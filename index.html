                                The event took place on the University of Bath campus, as a one day conference, on the <strong>7th of March 2020</strong>. Leading voices from activists and society joined students
                                and interested local attendees in order to share ideas and engage in discussions through workshops around the issues that we face both domestically and internationally.

                            <p>
                                The conference was composed of a series of succinct speaker talks and follow-up workshops that encouraged discussions on issues aligned with the One Young World values and the
                                UN Sustainable Development Goals.

                                This event was by the University of Bath in partnership with One Young World, a global organisation that focuses on harnessing the power of young leaders, who demonstrate
                                leadership ability and a commitment to effecting positive change. For this year in particular, we witnessed an inaugural partnership between the Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences and the

                                    Promoting the right to a quality education for all children and joining the fight against youth radicalisation, we are very proud to welcome Ahmad Nawaz to One Young World Bath 2020.

                                    Ahmad is a survivor of the Taliban attack on his school which took his brother and 150 of his classmates in Pakistan in December 2016.  He fled to the UK to receive treatment and in dealing with this trauma, he realised the Taliban targeted children as they don’t want children to be educated in order to be brainwashed. With this, he began visiting schools, colleges and universities throughout the UK to talk with students about his experience in prevention of young people from fleeing the UK to join these very terrorist groups.
                                    In 2018, he launched a nationwide campaign jointly with the UK Government called <b> Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) </b> that inspires young people to speak out and to become changemakers in their lives and communities.

He holds the <b> ‘Award for Bravery and Resilience’ </b> by the Government of Pakistan, is a winner of the <b> No2H8 Crime ‘Young Upstander Award’ </b>, <b> ‘Point of Light’ by the Prime Minister Theresa May </b> and won the <b> ’Stephen Sutton Inspiration Award’</b> at Pride of Birmingham 2019.

                                    Maggie resigned from Greater Manchester Police in 2012 in order to expose the handling of the sex abuse ring in Rochdale, Manchester, where young girls were being groomed. She decided to take this onto her own hands by helping young girls’ suffering to be brought to justice.

                                    Her story and the stories of the victims led to the multi award-winning dramatisation <b> Three Girls on BBC One </b> and helped to bring attention to some of the issues discussed to public attention. Since, she has appeared on newspapers, television shows such as This Morning, Loose Women, BBC, and led talks at events such as One Young World 2019 in London.
